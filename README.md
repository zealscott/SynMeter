### Statistical methods
| Method | Type | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
|**PGM**| DP |The method uses probabilistic graphical models to learn the dependence of low-dimensional marginals for data synthesis. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09136)|
|**PrivSyn**| DP | A non-parametric DP synthesizer, which iteratively updates the synthetic dataset to make it match the target noise marginals. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15128)|

### Generative adversarial networks(GANs)

| Method | Type | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
|**CTGAN**| HP | A conditional generative adversarial network which can handle tabular data.| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503)|
|**PATE-GAN**| DP | The method uses the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs.|  [Paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1zk9iRqF7) |

### Variational autoencoders(VAE)

| Method | Type | Description | Reference |
|--- | --- | --- | --- |
